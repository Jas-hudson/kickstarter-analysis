### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*This is a very broad analysis based solely on campaign outcomes (Successful, Failed, Canceled), launch dates, and funding goals.  A deeper analysis is needed to determine more precise trends for any future campaign planning*

## Results

- Outcomes based on Launch Date
  - May, June, and July had the highest successful campaigns
  - May, June, and July also presents the highest trending failure curve



- Outcomes based on Funding Goals

- Limitations of this dataset
  - Marketing budget
  - Type of advertising utilized
  - Geographical location and population of campaign cities
  - Demographic of backers  -  

- Possible tables and/or graphs to consider for further analysis

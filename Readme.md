### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*This is a very broad analysis based solely on campaign outcomes (Successful,Failed,Canceled), launch dates, and funding goals.  A deeper analysis is needed to determine more precise trends for any future campaign planning*

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
